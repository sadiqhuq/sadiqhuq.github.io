There are only few books on Finite Element Analysis that have engineers in the industry as the target audience. Many books written by academicians have the word 'applied' prefixed to their title but a quick look at the contents page would reveal that they are applied enough. Those books explain how the mathemetical formulations can be transformed into a computer program. It is indeed necessary to understand the concept of solving the partial differential equations using finite element method but it is usually taught comprehensively in a graduate course. It is only through experience that most young engineers learn the best practices to apply finite elements to industrial problems. Gladly, there are few resources that speed-up this learning process.


#### Fundamentals of Finite Element Method

In my MSc programme, I had four courses on Finite Elements in addition to a course on Continuum Mechanics.
