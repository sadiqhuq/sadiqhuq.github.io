There are only few books on Finite Element Analysis that have engineers in the industry as the target audience. Many books written by academicians have the word 'applied' prefixed to their title but a quick look at the contents page would reveal that they are not applied enough. Those books explain how the mathemetical formulations can be transformed into a computer program. It is indeed necessary to understand the concept of solving the partial differential equations using finite element method but it is usually taught comprehensively in a graduate course. It is only through experience that most young engineers learn the best practices to apply finite elements to industrial problems. Gladly, there are few resources that speed-up this learning process.    

Listed in order of my preference.  
  
  
#### Fundamentals of Finite Element Method
  
####  Practical FEA  
  
1. [Practical Aspects of Finite Element Simulation](https://altairuniversity.com/free-ebooks-2/free-ebook-practical-aspects-of-finite-element-simulation-a-study-guide/)  
   * This FREE book concisely covers everything-you-need-to-know. Just flipping through this book you will get an idea of how many nodes are needed to capture a hole, the basics of geometry clean-up, picking the right element type for the analysis, the choice of boundary conditions etc. Though the examples are illustrated with Altair products, the knowledge is transferable to other FEA tools.  
  
   * [There are also other good books from Altair on Crash Analysis, Multi-Body Simulations](https://altairuniversity.com/free-ebooks-2/)
